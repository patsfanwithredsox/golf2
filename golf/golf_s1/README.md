This golf program is meant to be used to calculate a players official golf handicap for each round that they play as dictated by the USGA. It starts by adding the total score from the round and then performs the necisarry operations to get the Handicap differential.  It then takes that differential and mulitiplies it by the USGA bonus percentage for good play which is 96%.  It then takes that result and truncates it to its whole integer to be used in tournaments for tee placement and grouping since most tournaments held by the USGA and local courses do not look past the decimal point for placements and memebership.
